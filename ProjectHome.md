This application needs root privileges.

Sometimes on Android 2.2+ devices, the external (or SD) app storage starts to have orphan applications, especially if you reset the device and did not wipe the external storage area.  CleanApp deletes such orphaned applications.

**Important information:** Only run this after all the icons have appeared after a reboot, otherwise it will report apps that haven't been mounted as orphans.
